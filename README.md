## Project Background  

Walmart, one of the largest U.S. retailers, wants to better understand drivers of weekly sales across stores. This project combines **6,445 weekly records (2010â€“2012)** with macroeconomic indicators like fuel prices, CPI index, unemployment rates, and holiday flags to evaluate patterns, forecastability, and actionable levers for sales.  

---

## Executive Summary  

- Walmartâ€™s sales dataset covers **45 stores, 2010â€“2012**, totaling **$584M in sales**.  
- Average weekly sales hover around **$999K per store**, with **+7.8% holiday lift**.  
- **Top 10 stores** generate disproportionately high sales ($180Mâ€“$270M each).  
- Seasonality: Sales peak in **November/December** (holiday season), trough in summer.  
- Macroeconomic variables (fuel price, unemployment, CPI) show **weak but negative correlations** with weekly sales.  
- Forecast dashboards and rolling averages indicate **short-term predictability**, but strong outliers (holiday spikes) make raw trends volatile.

## Insights Deep-Dive  

### 1. Sales Trends and Growth Rates  

- Weekly sales show **strong spikes during holidays** (Nov/Dec).  
- **12-week rolling averages** smooth out volatility, showing consistent end-of-year peaks.

### 2. Store Performance Leaderboard  

- Top stores significantly outperform others (Store 10 = $271M vs. Store 32 = $166M).  
- Useful for benchmarking best practices.

### 3. Holiday Impact  

- Average sales lift = **+7.8% during holiday weeks**.  
- Statistically significant (t-test p < 0.05).

### 4. Seasonality by Month and Year  

- Highest sales in **November & December**.  
- Lows in **February and July**.

### 5. Correlation & Macroeconomic Drivers  

- **Fuel Price (â€“0.01)**, **Unemployment Rate (â€“0.11)**, and **CPI (â€“0.07)** show weak inverse relationships with sales.  
- Suggests Walmartâ€™s demand is **resilient to macroeconomic pressure**, with holidays/seasonality driving more impact.

## Dashboard (Tableau)  

The Tableau dashboard consolidates KPIs and visuals:  

- **Filters**: Date Range, Holiday Flag  
- **KPI Cards**: Total Sales ($584M), Avg Sales ($999K), Holiday Impact (+7.8%)  
- **Charts**:  
  - Weekly Sales Over Time (line)  
  - Store Performance Leaderboard (bar)  
  - Sales vs Unemployment (scatter + trend)  
  - Seasonality by Month-Year (heatmap)  
  - Sales vs Fuel Prices (scatter)

## Recommendations  

1. **Holiday Optimization**: Increase inventory/promotions around holidays to leverage +7.8% lift.  
2. **Store Strategy**: Investigate top-performing stores (10, 27, 6) for best practices.  
3. **Forecasting Models**: Deploy rolling average or ARIMA models, accounting for holiday spikes.  
4. **Regional Insights**: Segment by geography if store metadata becomes available.  
5. **External Factors**: While macroeconomic drivers are weak, monitor CPI/fuel for lagged impacts.  

---

## Clarifying Questions & Assumptions  

- **Store metadata missing** â†’ cannot segment by region.  
- **holidays_flag** only binary â€” does not distinguish between Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc.  
- No 2013+ data, limiting longer-term forecasting.
