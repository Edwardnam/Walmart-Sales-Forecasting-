## Project Background  

Walmart, one of the largest U.S. retailers, wants to better understand drivers of weekly sales across its stores. This project analyzes **6,445 store-weeks (2010â€“2012)**, combining macroeconomic indicators such as fuel prices, CPI index, unemployment rates, and holiday flags.  

The objective is to:  
- Identify patterns in sales across time, stores, and external conditions.  
- Quantify the impact of holidays, seasonality, and macroeconomics.  
- Provide actionable insights to help management **improve forecasting and decision-making**.  

---

## Executive Summary  

- Walmartâ€™s dataset spans **45 stores, 2010â€“2012**, with **$584M total sales**.  
- **Average weekly sales â‰ˆ $999K per store**.  
- **Holidays provide a +7.8% lift**, with sales spikes particularly visible in November and December.  
- **Store inequality**: Top 10 stores account for more than **35% of total sales**, suggesting different performance tiers.  
- **Macroeconomic sensitivity is limited** (fuel, unemployment, CPI correlations are weak), indicating demand is driven by **seasonality and holiday behavior** more than external shocks.  
- Insights support a **holiday-optimized inventory strategy** and a **store-tiered benchmarking system**.

## Insights Deep-Dive  

### 1. Sales Trends and Growth Rates  

- Sales show strong **seasonal spikes**, especially in **November and December** (holiday shopping).  
- **12-week rolling averages** confirm sustained upward trends around holidays and volatility in summer months.  
- From 2010 to 2012, Walmart maintained **stable annual sales**, though 2012 shows slight declines in growth compared to prior years.

### 2. Store Performance Leaderboard  

- **Top store (Store 10)** generated **$271M total sales**, while the lowest-performing store managed only **$120Mâ€“$140M**.  
- Clear evidence of **tiered performance clusters**:  
  - Tier 1: $200M+ stores (flagship/high-traffic).  
  - Tier 2: $160Mâ€“$200M (average).  
  - Tier 3: <$150M (lagging).  
- This suggests **benchmarking opportunities**: lagging stores could learn from operational best practices of Tier 1 stores.

### 3. Holiday Impact  

- **Holiday lift = +7.8%**, statistically significant (t-test p < 0.05).  
- Average weekly sales:  
  - Holidays: ~$1.07M  
  - Non-Holidays: ~$995K  
- Indicates holidays are a **reliable demand accelerator** and should drive inventory & marketing strategy.

### 4. Seasonality by Month and Year  

- Peak: **December (holiday season)** with average weekly sales >$1.25M.  
- Troughs: **February & July** with dips to ~$950K.  
- Seasonality is consistent across 2010â€“2012, confirming **predictability of holiday cycles**.

### 5. Correlation & Macroeconomic Drivers  

- **Correlation Matrix Findings**:  
  - Fuel price vs. sales â†’ â€“0.01 (negligible).  
  - Unemployment rate vs. sales â†’ â€“0.11 (mildly negative).  
  - CPI vs. sales â†’ â€“0.07 (weakly negative).  
- Visual LOWESS regression confirms **minimal slope effects**.  
- Key takeaway: **Holidays and internal cycles matter far more than external economics**.

### 6. Additional Pivot Table Summaries  

#### a) Sales by Year  

| Year | Total Sales | Avg Weekly Sales | Growth vs Prior Year |  
|------|-------------|------------------|----------------------|  
| 2010 | $200M+      | ~$980K           | â€“ |  
| 2011 | $210M+      | ~$1.01M          | +3â€“4% |  
| 2012 | $175M+      | ~$975K           | â€“8â€“10% |  

âž¡ **Observation**: Growth peaked in 2011 but declined in 2012, likely due to post-recession stabilization.  

---

#### b) Average Weekly Sales by Store Tier  

| Store Tier | Definition            | Avg Weekly Sales | Key Insight |  
|------------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------|  
| Tier 1     | >$200M lifetime sales | $1.15M           | High-traffic, resilient |  
| Tier 2     | $160Mâ€“$200M           | ~$1.0M           | Average performers |  
| Tier 3     | <$150M                | $850Kâ€“$900K      | Turnaround targets |

## Recommendations  

1. **Holiday Optimization**: Expand stock and marketing around Novemberâ€“December to leverage +7.8% lift.  
2. **Tier-Based Benchmarking**: Use Tier 1 stores as models; audit Tier 3 stores for underperformance causes.  
3. **Forecasting Models**: Deploy time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet) with holiday dummies for more accurate planning.  
4. **Macro Monitoring**: Continue tracking CPI/unemployment, but prioritize internal drivers over external economics.  
5. **Scenario Planning**: Test inventory strategies against both baseline and holiday-lift scenarios.

## Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Caveats  

- Store metadata (region, size, demographics) is missing, limiting deeper segmentation.  
- `holidays_flag` is binary and does not distinguish specific holiday types.  
- Data ends in Oct 2012 â†’ limits post-2012 trend visibility.
